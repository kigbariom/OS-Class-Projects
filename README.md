Projects from my OS and Network class

These are samples of code taken from a class project in CS3600 Systems and Networks.

All of these files were given to the class with minimal starter code and stubbed functions. 

I they are missing make files and tests because I am only including these as samples of code I have done.

I worked with a partner on these assignments and passed 100% of the tests on all 3 projects.

3600sh is a linux shell client

3600dns is a DNS client

3600recv and 3600send are a TCP implementation
